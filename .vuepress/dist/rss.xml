<p>Do you ever get one of those feelings that someone made a mistake and there's no way you should be included in something? When I got the email inviting me to be one of the first <a href="https://developer.servicenow.com/blog.do?p=/post/all-stars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServiceNow Developer MVPs<OutboundLink/></a> for the year 2020 I definitely felt a bit that way.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had the honour of being invited to join Andrew Barnes on the ServiceNow Developer YouTube channel for their weekly Live Coding Happy Hour where developers have a beer (or coffee in my case) and work on some fun problems live on stream.</p>
<p>You can see the stream here:</p>

Only two days ago the Release Testing Preview of the ServiceNow Orlando version was made live for non-production instances. I know it's a bit weird, but I love reading <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-rtp-release-notes/page/rtp-rn/family-release-notes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release notes<OutboundLink/></a>! I've had a quick squizz and here's my pick of cool features and things to get excited about in list form.</p>
<p>Just a note: My background is ITSM / Platform, so I may not see or highlight cool stuff from other modules I haven't used.</p>

<p>Ever since ServiceNow announced the new <a href="https://account.servicenow.com/personal-data/11e9c2e8b/bd7f2d4ad/b40a6cdff/a1f44WP8E/resume.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Now Profile<OutboundLink/></a>, <a href="http://nowlearning.servicenow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Now Learning<OutboundLink/></a> and <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/now-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Now Creators<OutboundLink/></a> programs I have been meaning to spend some time looking through the offerings and getting a few of the badges and micro-certs (for free!).</p>

<p>I have been meaning to update my personal website ever since I realised crappy HTML and a Wordpress blog stopped me from really enjoying writing and web design. I have also been rather busy with work and having two (2!) kids.</p>
