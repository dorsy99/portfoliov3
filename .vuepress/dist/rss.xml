Only two days ago the Release Testing Preview of the ServiceNow Orlando version was made live for non-production instances. I know it's a bit weird, but I love reading <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-rtp-release-notes/page/rtp-rn/family-release-notes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release notes<OutboundLink/></a>! I've had a quick squizz and here's my pick of cool features and things to get excited about in list form.</p>

<p>Ever since ServiceNow announced the new <a href="https://account.servicenow.com/personal-data/11e9c2e8b/bd7f2d4ad/b40a6cdff/a1f44WP8E/resume.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Now Profile<OutboundLink/></a>, <a href="http://nowlearning.servicenow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Now Learning<OutboundLink/></a> and <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/now-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Now Creators<OutboundLink/></a> programs I have been meaning to spend some time looking through the offerings and getting a few of the badges and micro-certs (for free!).</p>
