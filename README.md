I'm a Husband and Father of two, and work as a ServiceNow Developer for an insurance company in Australia.

I've revamped my personal site because I want to share with the world my excitement about the ServiceNow Platform and Community. 

Check out my [Blog](/blog/) for my writing (some of which will be personal, some cross-posted from the [ServiceNow Community](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_user_profile&user=86ae4a2ddbd41fc09c9ffb651f961957)) or my [Resume](/resume/) for my experience and achievements.

But most of all, Thanks!
